# Galleoncoin
Source Code for Galleoncoin

This is the Initial Commit for the Galleoncoin PIVX fork.
We have 5,000,000 PoW blocks, with Block Halving Introduced t block 1,250,000

1-1250000 = 1000 gale
1250000-2500000 = 500 gale
2500000-3750000= 250 gale
3750000 - 5000000 = 125 gale
5000000-infinity.= 5 gale


1 block per minute.

In PoS phase rewards will drop to 5 GALE.

Upcoming improvments to the project:
Cleanup UI
Change Icon, colorscheme
